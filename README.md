# ImageTriage

ImageTriage is a simple, efficient web-based tool for sorting and organizing your image files. It allows users to quickly navigate through a folder of images, deciding which ones to keep and which to move to a separate "deny" folder.

## Important Notes

- This application requires a browser that supports the File System Access API. It has been tested and confirmed to work on recent versions of Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
- The tool operates directly on your local files. While it's designed to be safe, it's always a good idea to back up your files before using any file management tool.
- ImageTriage does not upload your images to any server. All operations are performed locally in your browser.
- As this tool is web-based and uses modern APIs, make sure your browser is up to date for the best experience.
